    <p>
      Oyakodon is a delicious traditional Japanese meal consisting of chicken
      saut√©ed and then cooked in dashi, and then finished with egg and served
      over rice. It's really easy, filling, and delicious.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
      <li>1-2 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>1/2 yellow onion</li>
      <li>1/4 cup dashi stock</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon mirin</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 serving white rice</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut chicken thighs into bite sized pieces, around 3/4-1 in squares.
      </li>
      <li>Slice onions lengthwise about 1/4 in wide.</li>
      <li>
        Crack the eggs into a bowl and very lightly beat the eggs, aiming to
        leave the yolk and egg whites generally unmixed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the dashi, soy saue, miring, and brown sugar into one seasonings
        mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook before onion
        becomes translucent, then pour the seasonings mixture and let it simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chicken on top of the onions, making sure to even distribute it on
        the onions. Cook until the chicken is no longer pink and onions are
        tender, flipping the chicken halfway through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk eggs in a bowl, then pour into the skillet. Cover the skillet,
        reduce the heat, and steam until the egg is cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay over rice in a bowl and serve, garnishing with optional spring onion
        slices.
      </li>
    </ol>
